# Introduction

This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis.
It was a solo project createing MVP app in two days.

# Technology Used

1. React (create-react-app) (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
1. react-webcam: (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-webcam)
1. ml5.js
1. Material-UI
1. Heroku

Write why I chose these technologies

# What challenges did you face?

realizing function that does not exist.
Heroku Error R14 (Memory quota exceeded)

# What did you learn?

Investigate functionality first if it's feasible.
Using video takes too much memory and makes the app unstable.

# Future Ideas/Features

Solve multiple run of classification logic
Use Redux
To be able to save the model
Less memory usage
